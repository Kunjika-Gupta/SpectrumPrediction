# SpectrumAI-LSTM

**Predicting Spectrum Occupancy Using LSTM Networks**

---

## Project Overview

This project implements an **LSTM-based neural network** to predict spectrum occupancy (Idle/Busy) in time-series data.  
It demonstrates **single-step predictions** and evaluates model performance using **accuracy, MSE**, and visualizations of predicted vs actual occupancy.

---

## Features

- Predict spectrum occupancy using LSTM networks  
- Visualize predicted vs actual occupancy  
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Plots for comparison  
- Modular code for experimenting with LSTM layers, units, and hyperparameters

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
